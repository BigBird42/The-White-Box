# The-White-Box
Digital effects pedal for Guitar and Bass using the MSP430FR5969 to run the user interface and the TMS320C5535 for the effects processing.

# Progress
I have finished the code for the MSP430 launchpad, the code to communicate with the DSP will not be written until I have a prototype made. I'm currently writing the effects processing functions for the C5535 DSP.
