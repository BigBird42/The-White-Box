# The White Box
The White Box is a digital effect pedal for guitar and bass. It does standard effects processing such as distortion, delays, and other time based effects. Most of these effects are currently implemented in separate pieces of hardware, this project is attempting to put merge all these effects into a single multi effects pedal.
