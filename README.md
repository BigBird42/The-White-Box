Digital effects pedal for Guitar and Bass

# Progress
Currently I'm working on a prototype for the project using the MSP430FR4133 launchpad and the TMDX5535 ezDSP kit. Currently the code for the FR4133 doesn't match the schematic I have on this project. When that code is finished I will change it to work with my schematic and add it to a software folder in this repo.
