# The White Box
The White Box is a digital effect pedal for guitar and bass. It does standard effects processing such as distortion, delays, and other time based effects. Most of these effects are currently implemented in individual effect pedals, this project is attempting to put merge all these effects into a single multi effects pedal. Documentation how the design works can be found in /Documentation, The schematics for the PCB's can be found in /Hardware, and code for the processors can be found in /Software.
