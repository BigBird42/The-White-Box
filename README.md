# The-White-Box
Digital effects pedal for Guitar and Bass

# Progress
Currently I'm working on a prototype for the project using the MSP430FR5969 launchpad and the TMDX5535 ezDSP kit. You can find code for the MSP430FR4133 Launchpad which I'm using to prototype the project before getting my design fabricated and assembled. When I get the design built I will port over the code from the FR4133 Launchpad to the FR5969.

# Next steps
Front Panel :

I would like to finish simplifying the debounce and state machines that handle user inputs. Then I want to put together a set of menus that the user can move through using buttons and the rotary encoders.

Main Board :

When I'm finished with the stuff above in the Front Panel section I will begin programming the c5535 DSP. I have one of the ezDSP kits right now so once I'm finished with the front panel I can move onto the DSP. I will update this section once I've begun programming the DSP.
