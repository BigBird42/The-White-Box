Digital effects pedal for Guitar and Bass

# Progress
Currently I'm working on a prototype for the project using the MSP430FR5969 launchpad and the TMDX5535 ezDSP kit. You can find code for the MSP430FR4133 Launchpad which I'm using to prototype the project before getting my design fabricated and assembled. When I get the design built I will port over the code from the FR4133 Launchpad to the FR5969.
