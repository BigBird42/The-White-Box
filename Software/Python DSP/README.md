# Python DSP
Using numpy and scipy wav files are read in and the corresponding frames are written to a text file wav_in.txt. The c++ program "effects" processes the wave file one sample at a time and writes the output to wave_out.txt. Using python again the data is written to a new wav file.
Using effects.sh runs both the c++ program and writes the data to a wav file.
