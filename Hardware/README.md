# CAD Program
The schematics and eventually the PCBs will all be designed in Kicad(http://kicad-pcb.org/). Inside each kicad project section there is a pdf plot of the current schematic.

# Front Panel Prototype
The Front panel prototype folder contains CAD files for the PCB i'm using to prototype the code for the front panel section. It's meant to be interfaced with an MSP430FR4133 Launchpad or with a TI target board. The pcb can be viewed at OSH Park [here](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/eVYitc5U).
