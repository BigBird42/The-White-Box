Software
--------
This section contains general information on the control flow of the program. For detailed information on each menu look at the "UI.txt" 
file in this folder. The program begins in main and runs some initialization functions and then enters the main loop of the program. 
Each of the menus called from here returns a character denoting the next menu that should be called. The menu's are implemented as 
infinite loops with switch statements to determine what to do after a particular user input. If there is some definition or function
you can't find it's most likely in "peripherals.h", it contains most things that I couldn't find a better place to put.

How user inputs are processed
-----------------------------
The program normally is in low power mode (LPM), this is enabled by the wait_for_input loop located in peripherals.c until an interrupt 
it triggered. The only way to get out of this loop is by an interrupt, either the real time clock or the timer interrupt. The timer interrupt happens every 1-5ms and checks for changes to the buttons or rotary encoders. If a change is detected the state machines are called. The button state machine is pretty self explanatory. The encoder state machine uses an array to keep track of where the encoder is in it's rotation.
The integer returned by wait_for_input correspond to the following actions:
0x0000 no action
0x0001 enc1 sw
0x0002 enc2 sw
0x0004 enc3 sw
0x0008 enc4 sw
0x0010 sw left
0x0020 sw right
0x0040 sw select
0x0080 sw settings
0x0100 enc1 CCW rotation
0x0200 enc1 CW rotation
0x0400 enc2 CCW rotation
0x0800 enc2 CW rotation
0x1000 enc3 CCW rotation
0x2000 enc3 CW rotation
0x4000 enc4 CCW rotation
0x8000 enc4 CW rotation
0xFFFF RTC interrupt
For integers 0x0001 - 0x0080 their inverse corresponds to the button being push down so for example:
0xFFFE means enc1 sw is pushed down 0x0001 means enc1 sw is released

Hardware
--------
The front panel is the user interface portion of the pedal. The front panel consists of a 4x20 character LCD, 8 LED's, 4 rotary encoders
with switches, 3 footswitches, and 1 settings switch. Power is supplied for this board by the main board over a 2x7 connector labeled
at the bottom of the schematic. The details of the LCD display are located in the "UI.txt" file in this folder. Each of the 8 LED's 
denotes when a particular effect is enabled, these effects currently include wah, ring mod, phaser, drive/fuzz, flange,pitch shift, 
delay, and tremolo/vibrato.
